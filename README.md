# Offline-ChatGPT
Im trying to create a version of ChatGPT or at least a similar programm to ChatGPT that may not be as good as ChatGPT but you can use offline. I will code it in python and upload the raw python file but I will also try to create .exe .apk and .ipa files. I dont know how to make .apk and . ipa files yet but i want to learn it eventually.
