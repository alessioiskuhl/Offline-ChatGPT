# My Goal
My goal is to create a version of ChatGPT or at least a similar programm to ChatGPT that may not be as good as ChatGPT but you can use offline. This is so yoou can use it everywhere where you need it, my original idea is to put it on my iPad so I can use it in School. I want to code it in python and upload the raw python file but I will also try to create .exe .apk and .ipa files. I dont know how to make .apk and . ipa files yet but i want to learn it eventually.

# Compatibility
As said I want it to work on most pcs as a **<ins>.exe</ins>** file and as some mobile versions like **<ins>.apk</ins>** and **<ins>.ipa</ins>** but I will also upload the **<ins>raw python file</ins>** so people can improve it.
