# My Goal
My goal is to create a version of [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) or at least a similar programm to [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) that may not be as good as [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) but you can use offline. This is so yoou can use it everywhere where you need it, my original idea is to put it on my iPad so I can use it in School. I want to code it in python and upload the raw python file but I will also try to create .exe .apk and .ipa files. I dont know how to make .apk and . ipa files yet but i want to learn it eventually.

# Compatibility
As said I want it to work on most pcs as a **<ins>.exe</ins>** file and as some mobile versions like **<ins>.apk</ins>** and **<ins>.ipa</ins>** but I will also upload the **<ins>raw python file</ins>** so people can improve it.

## Installation process
### The .exe file
This is definitly the easiest way to install my project on your computer. You just have to download the OffGPT.exe file and run it by double clicking on it. And you're done! <ins>**But Note that this only works for Windows computers, i dont know if this works on mac computers.**</ins>
### Raw python file
First first download the python file and go to the [**<ins>official python download website</ins>**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download python. After installing python press windows + r and type cmd if you have a windows computer. After pressing enter or ok you will land in a window where you can type code, now you have to type cd + your downlooad folder, it should look similar to this:

```python
cd Downloads
```
or to be safe type:

```python
cd C:/Your User/downloads
```
after doing that run this command:
```python
python OffGPT.py
```
if that isnt working try
```python
python3 OffGPT.py
```
Now the file should just run, if there were any errors submit them to the [Issues](https://github.com/alessioiskuhl/Offline-ChatGPT/issues)



> [!NOTE]
> I am a beginner developer and only know a bit about python so please dont say anything like my python is bad. To help me learn you can put my mistakes in the issue tab and tell me exactly what I did wrong. **<ins>Thank You</ins>**
