# My Goal
My goal is to create a version of [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) or at least a similar programm to [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) that may not be as good as [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) but you can use offline. This is so yoou can use it everywhere where you need it, my original idea is to put it on my iPad so I can use it in School. I want to code it in python and upload the raw python file but I will also try to create .exe .apk and .ipa files. I dont know how to make .apk and . ipa files yet but i want to learn it eventually.

# Compatibility
As said I want it to work on most pcs as a **<ins>.exe</ins>** file and as some mobile versions like **<ins>.apk</ins>** and **<ins>.ipa</ins>** but I will also upload the **<ins>raw python file</ins>** so people can improve it.

# Notice âš 
I am a beginner developer and only know a bit about python so please dont say anything like my python is bad. To help me learn you can put my mistakes in the issue tab and tell me exactly what I did wrong. **<ins>Thank You</ins>**
